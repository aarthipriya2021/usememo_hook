Hooks:
     -	Hooks are the functions which "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from        
            function  components	.
    -	React offers a number of built-in Hooks. A few of these include  useState(),    
         useEffect(),  useContext(), useReducer(),    and useRef() 

Rules:
    -   Never call Hooks from inside a loop, condition or nested function
    -   Hooks should sit at the top-level of your component
    -   Only call Hooks from React functional components
    -   Never call a Hook from a regular function
    -   Hooks can call other Hooks

usememo:
    -   The useMemo is a hook used in the functional component of react that returns a memoized value.
    -   useMemo will call the function and return its return value.
syntax:
    const memoizedValue = useMemo(functionThatReturnsValue, arrayDepencies)
